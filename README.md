# Interview Coach

A Claude Code-based interview coach that guides you through your entire job search — from first resume review to post-offer negotiation. It scores your answers across five dimensions, diagnoses root causes behind weak spots, builds a storybank you can retrieve under pressure, and adapts its coaching to your specific patterns. Not a generic question bank. An adaptive system that gets sharper the more you use it.

Say `kickoff`, share your resume, and you're being coached in under 2 minutes.

## What It Does

**Scoring and diagnosis** — Every answer scored on Substance, Structure, Relevance, Credibility, and Differentiation, calibrated to your seniority. Scores map to root causes (status anxiety, narrative hoarding, conflict avoidance) with targeted fixes, not just "do better."

**Adaptive coaching** — After scoring, a decision tree triages your bottleneck and branches to the right drill. If Relevance is your gap, you get question-decoding practice. If Substance, you build raw material. The system doesn't cycle through the same sequence for every candidate.

**Storybank** — Structured story management with full STAR text, earned secrets, strength ratings, and rapid-retrieval drills so you can access the right story under time pressure. Narrative identity extraction finds the 2-3 core themes across your stories so every answer reinforces a coherent thesis about who you are.

**Practice and mocks** — 8-stage drill progression (constraint ladders, pushback handling, pivot drills, panel simulations, stress tests) plus full 4-6 question mock interviews in behavioral, system design, case study, panel, and technical+behavioral formats. Every round includes the interviewer's perspective — what they were actually thinking when you spoke.

**Interview lifecycle** — Company research, role-specific prep briefs with interviewer intelligence, same-day post-interview debrief, outcome tracking that correlates practice scores with real results, and post-offer negotiation coaching with exact scripts.

**Session continuity** — A persistent `coaching_state/` directory with separate files tracks your storybank, scores, patterns, drill progression, and interview loops across sessions. Only the files needed for each command are loaded, keeping context lean. Pick up where you left off, weeks later. Saves are automatic.

**Differentiation** — Earned secrets and spiky POVs are a first-class dimension, not an afterthought. The system pushes you past "competent" toward "memorable."

**Self-awareness** — Tracks the gap between your self-assessment and actual coach scores. Knows if you're an over-rater or under-rater, and adjusts coaching accordingly.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Open in Claude Code on Desktop (recommended)

The simplest path. Open this repo directly from Claude Code on Desktop:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noamseg/interview-coach-skill.git
cd interview-coach-skill
```

Or [download it as a ZIP](https://github.com/noamseg/interview-coach-skill/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip.

2. Activate the coach by renaming the skill file:

```bash
mv SKILL.md CLAUDE.md
```

3. Open the folder in Claude Code on Desktop and say `kickoff`.

The coach will ask for your resume, target role, and timeline — then build your profile, assess your starting point, and give you a prioritized action plan. Everything saves automatically to `coaching_state/` files so you pick up where you left off next session.

**Also works with**: Claude Code (terminal), Cursor, or any environment with file system access.

### 2) Company research (before committing to prep)

```text
research Notion
```

Expected output:

- Company snapshot (stage, size, culture signals)
- Fit assessment against your profile
- "If you decide to apply" next steps

### 3) Before an interview

```text
prep Stripe
```

Then provide:

- Job description
- Role/seniority
- Optional interviewer LinkedIn URLs (for per-interviewer intelligence)

Expected output:

- `Interview Format` (with format-specific coaching boundaries)
- `Company Culture Read`
- `Interviewer Intelligence` (if profile links provided — per-interviewer lens, focus areas, rapport hooks, story recommendations)
- `What They Optimize For`
- `Your Best Positioning`
- `Likely Concerns + Counters`
- `Predicted Questions (7-10)`
- `Story Mapping`
- `Questions To Ask Them`
- `Day-Of Cheat Sheet`

### 4) Right after an interview

```text
debrief
```

Rapid capture while details are fresh — works with or without a transcript. Get:

- Questions recalled and reconstructed answers
- Interviewer signals observed (engagement, skepticism, interest)
- Stories used (auto-updates storybank `Last Used` dates)
- Coaching state updated for the next session

### 5) Analyzing a transcript

```text
analyze
```

Then paste transcript text.

Expected output:

- Per-answer score blocks
- `Scorecard`
- `Triage Decision` (data-driven coaching path based on your patterns)
- `What Is Working`
- `Top 3 Gaps To Close`
- `Storybank Changes`
- `Priority Move (Next 72 Hours)`

### 6) Drill practice

```text
practice
```

Drills (in progression order — advance when you meet gating thresholds):

- `practice ladder` — Constraint drills (30s, 60s, 90s, 3min)
- `practice pushback` — Handle skepticism and interruption
- `practice pivot` — Redirect when questions don't match prep
- `practice gap` — Handle "I don't have an example" moments
- `practice role` — Role-specific specialist scrutiny
- `practice panel` — Multiple interviewer personas
- `practice stress` — High-pressure simulation
- `practice technical` — Thinking out loud, clarification-seeking, tradeoff articulation (system design / case study / mixed format only)

Standalone (not gated):

- `practice retrieval` — Rapid-fire story matching under time pressure

Expected output each round:

- `Round Debrief`
- `What Worked`

## Best Results

1. Share a real resume (not a high-level summary).
2. Include a full job description for `prep` — and the interview format if you know it.
3. Use real transcripts for `analyze`. The more you give it, the better the triage.
4. Keep a living storybank with `stories`. Extract earned secrets for every story.
5. Run `progress` weekly — it tracks your self-assessment accuracy, not just scores.
6. After real interviews, log outcomes. The system correlates practice scores with real results.
7. Run `mock` before important interviews. Individual drills build skills; mocks test the full arc.
8. Use `debrief` the same day as a real interview — capture signals while they're fresh.

## FAQ

**How is this different from asking ChatGPT for interview help?**
Generic LLM interview help gives you the same advice regardless of your patterns. This system scores you on five dimensions, tracks your scores over time, diagnoses root causes behind weak spots, builds a storybank with retrieval drills, and adapts its coaching based on what the data reveals. It remembers your previous sessions, knows which stories you've already used at a company, and changes its approach when something isn't working. It's the difference between a textbook and a coach.

**Does this only work for tech roles?**
No. Core workflows are role-agnostic; role drills include PM, Engineering, Design, Data Science, Research, Operations, and Marketing.

**Why is the feedback direct?**
The skill is intentionally high-candor and evidence-based. It uses strengths-first delivery and self-reflection before critique. It also periodically checks whether the coaching is landing and adapts if not. You can set your feedback directness level (1-5) during kickoff.

**How does it work across multiple sessions?**
The skill writes to a `coaching_state/` directory with separate files for your profile, storybank, scores, sessions, and per-company interview loops. At the start of each session, it reads only the files it needs and picks up where you left off. This keeps context lean even after weeks of coaching. Saves happen automatically after every major workflow — not just at session end.
