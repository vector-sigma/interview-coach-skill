# hype — Pre-Interview Boost Workflow

### Data-Driven Hype

The hype reel should be built from real coaching data, not generic encouragement:
- **Pull from practice high points**: Reference the candidate's best practice moments — "In your last practice session, you nailed the prioritization question with a 4 on Structure. That's the level you're bringing today."
- **Reference strongest stories**: Name the 2-3 stories that scored highest in the storybank and are mapped to this interview.
- **Use real score trajectory**: If scores have been improving, name it — "Your Structure scores went from 2s to consistent 4s over the last three sessions. That's not luck."
- If no coaching data exists yet (first session), build from resume strengths and kickoff profile. Be explicit about this: "I don't have practice scores or storybank data to draw from yet — this hype reel is built from your resume and what you've told me. It'll be more powerful once we've done some practice rounds together."

### No-Data Fallback

When `coaching_state/scores.md` is empty or has no scores, don't output a hollow version of the data-driven hype. Instead, shift to a different mode:
- Lead with resume-grounded strengths (from kickoff resume analysis)
- Focus the warmup routine on calming techniques rather than score references
- Use the candidate's stated biggest concern (from kickoff) as the basis for the 3x3
- Be honest: "Once you've done some practice rounds, this hype reel will reference your specific high points and score trajectory. For now, here's what's genuinely strong about your profile."

### Interview-Specific Tailoring

If a `prep` brief exists for the upcoming interview, the hype should reference it directly:
- "You're about to talk to [Interviewer Name], who based on their background will likely focus on [area]. Your [Story Title] is perfect for this."
- "This is a [format] interview. Remember: [format-specific key advice from prep]."
- "Their top concern about you is probably [from concerns]. Your counter: [one sentence]."

If no prep exists, say so and suggest running `prep` first if time allows.

### Output Schema

## 60-Second Hype Reel
- Line 1: [grounded in real coaching data or resume strengths]
- Line 2: [specific evidence of capability]
- Line 3: [reference to best story or practice moment]
- Line 4: [what makes you different from other candidates]

## Focus Cue
- One thing to remember in the room:

## 10-Minute Warmup Routine
1. Read this hype reel out loud once.
2. Pick your weakest story and deliver the 60-second version out loud (constraint ladder).
3. Review the 3x3 above — don't memorize, just refresh.
4. Physical reset: [walk, stretch, breathe — whatever routine works for you].
5. Reframe: "This is a conversation to see if there's mutual fit. I'm also interviewing them."

## If You Have Back-to-Back Interviews
- Between interviews: 5-minute reset. Don't review notes — your brain needs a break, not more input.
- Physical reset: stand up, walk, get water, stretch. Change your physical state.
- Mental reset: "That interview is done. I can't change it. This next one starts fresh."
- Don't carry energy from the previous interview — good or bad. Each interviewer is meeting you for the first time.
- If you bombed the last one: "That conversation is over. This interviewer doesn't know about it and doesn't care."
- Quick re-read: glance at the Day-Of Cheat Sheet for the next interviewer (if different from the last).

#### Questions Sourcing

If `questions` was previously run for this company (check Interview Loops for saved prepared questions), pull from those for the 3x3. Don't regenerate — consistency matters.

#### Recovery Section Sourcing

For "If You Bomb an Answer Mid-Interview," inline key guidance from the Psychological Readiness Module (Mid-Interview Recovery) in `references/cross-cutting.md`. For "If You Get a Question You Have No Story For," inline key guidance from the Gap-Handling Module (Pattern 1: Adjacent Bridge) in `references/cross-cutting.md`.
