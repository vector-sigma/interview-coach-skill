# prep — Prep Brief Workflow

### Required Inputs

- Company
- Role title/seniority
- Job description

### Optional Inputs

- Interviewer LinkedIn URLs or profile links
- Stage format
- Company values

### Logic

1. Identify interview format (see format taxonomy below).
2. If interviewer profile links provided, research interviewer profiles and extract intelligence (see Interviewer Intelligence section below). If only names provided, ask for LinkedIn URLs.
3. **Parse the JD for competencies** (see JD Parsing Guide below).
4. Identify company interviewing culture (see company archetype intelligence below).
5. Infer top evaluation criteria (adjusted for format + culture).
6. Map candidate strengths and risks — incorporate interviewer-specific adjustments if intel available.
7. **Check storybank status.** If the candidate hasn't built a storybank yet (no `coaching_state/storybank.md` or storybank is empty), flag it before story mapping: "You don't have a storybank yet, so I can't map stories to predicted questions. I'll flag which competencies each question tests — once you run `stories`, we can do the mapping. Want to build your storybank now, or continue with the rest of the prep?" If a storybank exists, proceed with mapping.
8. Generate likely questions and story mapping (or competency mapping if no storybank).
9. Generate non-generic interviewer questions.

### JD Parsing Guide

The quality of predicted questions depends entirely on how well you read the JD. Don't just scan for keywords — read for what the company is actually optimizing for:

1. **Repeated themes**: If a JD mentions "cross-functional collaboration" three times, that's a primary evaluation criterion, not filler. Count how often key themes appear.
2. **Order and emphasis**: What's listed first in responsibilities? In requirements? First = highest priority in most JDs.
3. **"Nice to have" vs. "required"**: The required section is what they'll screen on. The nice-to-have section reveals what a Strong Hire looks like beyond baseline.
4. **Verb choices**: "Own" vs. "support" vs. "contribute to" — these signal the level of autonomy and scope expected. "Own end-to-end" is a very different expectation than "contribute to team efforts."
5. **Between-the-lines signals**: "Fast-paced environment" = they're understaffed. "Ambiguity" = undefined role, needs self-direction. "Stakeholder management" = political environment. "Wearing multiple hats" = small team, broad scope.
6. **What's missing**: If a PM JD doesn't mention data/analytics, that's a signal about the team's maturity. If an engineering JD doesn't mention testing, note it.

Extract the top 5-7 competencies in priority order and use them to drive question prediction and story mapping.

### Interview Format Taxonomy

Different formats require fundamentally different prep, pacing, and scoring weights. Identify which format and adjust accordingly:

| Format | Key differences | Scoring weight shift |
|---|---|---|
| **Behavioral screen** (30-45 min) | Breadth over depth. 5-8 questions, short answers. Efficiency is paramount. | Structure + Relevance weighted highest |
| **Deep behavioral** (45-60 min) | Depth. Follow-ups expected. Must sustain a story through probing. | Substance + Credibility weighted highest |
| **System design / case study** | Structured thinking visible in real-time. Process matters as much as answer. **Highly variable across companies** — run Format Discovery Protocol below before coaching. Coach focuses on communication layer, not solution correctness. | Structure + Substance weighted highest. Credibility scored on process rigor, not answer correctness. |
| **Presentation round** | Prepared content + Q&A handling. Storytelling + poise under challenge. | Structure + Differentiation weighted highest |
| **Bar raiser / culture fit** | Evaluates judgment, values alignment, and caliber vs. company bar. | Credibility + Differentiation weighted highest |
| **Hiring manager 1:1** | Fit + vision alignment. Often less structured. Read signals. | Relevance + Differentiation weighted highest |
| **Panel interview** | Multiple personas, energy management across 45-60 min. | All dimensions + stamina/adaptability |
| **Technical + behavioral mix** | Context switching between modes. Must signal both depth and breadth. **Format varies widely** — run Format Discovery Protocol below before coaching. Coach focuses on mode-switching, behavioral integration, and thinking-out-loud skills. | Substance + Structure weighted highest. Scored on communication across modes, not technical output quality. |

If the candidate doesn't know the format, prep for behavioral screen (most common) and flag: "If you can find out the format, I can sharpen this significantly."

### Format Discovery Protocol (System Design / Case Study and Technical + Behavioral Mix)

These formats vary more across companies than any other interview type. A system design interview at Google looks nothing like a case study at McKinsey or a technical deep-dive at a Series B startup. Rather than prescribing how these interviews work, the coach must discover what the candidate's specific format looks like.

**Run this protocol whenever the identified format is system design/case study or technical+behavioral mix — in `prep`, `mock`, or `practice technical`.**

#### Discovery Questions (ask before any format-specific coaching)

Ask one at a time. Adapt based on responses — skip questions the candidate has already answered.

1. "What do you know about the format of this interview? Has the recruiter described it?"
2. "Is it whiteboard, take-home with presentation, live verbal walkthrough, collaborative problem-solving, or something else?"
3. "How long is the session? Is it the full time on one problem, or split across multiple?"
4. "Do you get the problem in advance, or is it presented live?"
5. "Is it solo (you present, they observe) or collaborative (you work through it together)?"
6. "Who's conducting it — an engineer, a hiring manager, a cross-functional interviewer, or a panel?"
7. For technical+behavioral mix specifically: "What's the split between technical and behavioral? Do they alternate questions, or is it segmented (first half technical, second half behavioral)? One interviewer or a handoff?"

#### If the Candidate Doesn't Know the Format

Don't guess. Help them find out:

- "Ask your recruiter directly: 'Can you describe the format of the [round name] interview? Is it a system design exercise, a case study, or something else? How long is it, and what should I expect?' Recruiters almost always answer this."
- "Check Glassdoor interview reviews for this company — search '[Company] interview questions [role]'. Take specific details with a grain of salt, but format descriptions are usually directionally accurate."
- "Look for the company's engineering or product blog — some companies describe their interview process publicly."

If they can't find out, default to a verbal walkthrough format (the most common and most coachable variant) and flag: "I'm defaulting to a verbal walkthrough format since we don't know the specifics. If you learn more about the format, tell me — it'll change how we prep."

#### Saving Discovered Format

After running Format Discovery, save the format details so subsequent commands don't re-ask:

- **`coaching_state/profile.md`** (general): Update the `Known interview formats` field with any new format types discovered.
- **`coaching_state/loops/[company-slug].md`** (company-specific): Save structured format details per round:
  ```
  - Round formats:
    - Round 1: Behavioral screen, 45min, recruiter
    - Round 2: System design, 50min verbal walkthrough, collaborative, senior engineer
    - Round 3: Technical+behavioral mix, 60min, alternating, hiring manager
  ```
  Include format type, duration, format variant (if applicable), and interviewer type for each round. This level of detail allows `mock`, `practice technical`, and `hype` to tailor their output without re-running discovery.

This prevents re-running discovery when the candidate later runs `mock`, `practice technical`, or `hype` for the same company.

#### Format Variability Acknowledgment

When coaching for these formats, be explicit that your guidance is adapted to what the candidate has described, not to insider knowledge of the company's process: "I'm working from what you've told me about the format. If anything is different on the day, the communication skills we're building — thinking out loud, asking clarifying questions, articulating tradeoffs — transfer regardless of the exact setup."

### Technical Format Coaching Boundaries

This coach's value in system design, case study, and technical+behavioral mix interviews is **communication coaching** — how you structure and articulate your thinking — not domain expertise. Be explicit about this boundary upfront, not as a caveat after the fact.

#### What the Coach Can Do

- Coach the **communication layer**: how to structure thinking out loud, narrate decisions, explain tradeoffs, and make your reasoning process visible to the interviewer
- Coach **question-asking and clarification-seeking** behavior — candidates who jump to solutions without scoping the problem get penalized in almost every system design format, and this is highly coachable
- Practice **talking about past technical decisions** under scrutiny (the role drills already do this well)
- Help with the **behavioral components** of mixed-format interviews — the storytelling, credibility, and differentiation skills that transfer directly
- Coach **handling probing questions** about tradeoffs, constraints, and failure modes — these appear in every technical format regardless of company
- Coach **energy management and context-switching** across mixed-format interviews, which are often 50-70 minute marathons
- Simulate the **interpersonal dynamics** of these interviews — skeptical interviewers, ambiguous prompts, time pressure, "why not X?" challenges

#### What the Coach Cannot Do

- **Evaluate system design solutions for technical correctness.** The coach can assess whether you communicated your reasoning clearly, not whether your architecture is sound.
- **Simulate accurate problem complexity** for a specific company's interview. Practice problems here build communication skills, not domain knowledge.
- **Replicate company-specific case study formats.** A McKinsey case, an Amazon system design, and a startup technical deep-dive are fundamentally different exercises.
- **Score technical output quality.** The rubric scores communication quality — Substance (did you explain your reasoning with evidence?), Structure (could the interviewer follow your thinking?), Credibility (did you acknowledge constraints and tradeoffs?).
- **Teach domain-specific technical knowledge** (data structures, system components, framework selection, etc.). The candidate must bring this knowledge; the coach helps them communicate it.

#### Specific Trigger Points

When the conversation enters these territories, name the boundary:

- **Candidate asks "Is my design correct?"** → "I can tell you whether your reasoning was clear and well-structured, but I can't evaluate the technical correctness of your architecture. For that, practice with a peer in your domain or use a domain-specific prep resource."
- **Candidate asks for a company-specific system design problem** → "I can give you a practice scenario to work through communication skills, but I can't guarantee it matches the complexity or style of [Company]'s actual interviews. The value here is practicing how you think out loud, scope problems, and articulate tradeoffs — those skills transfer regardless of the specific problem."
- **Discussion enters domain-specific technical depth** → "This is getting into [specific domain] territory where you need a domain expert, not a communication coach. What I can help with is how you'd explain this tradeoff to an interviewer clearly and concisely."
- **Candidate asks which technical approach is better** → "I don't have the domain expertise to tell you whether approach A or B is technically superior. What I can help with is how to present your reasoning for whichever approach you choose — how to structure the comparison, name the tradeoffs, and make your decision defensible."

Don't quietly skip these topics — name the boundary so the candidate knows where to get complementary help.

### Company Archetype Intelligence

Companies have interviewing cultures that transcend individual JDs. When a known company is specified, apply culture-specific coaching — **but only from verified sources**.

#### Company Knowledge Sourcing (Critical)

This is a high-stakes area. Telling a candidate "Stripe values X in interviews" when you're guessing can actively hurt them. Every company-specific claim must be sourced to one of three tiers:

**Tier 1 — Verified (cite the source):**
Claims based on information you can actually retrieve and point to during this session:
- The company's own website (values page, careers page, leadership principles, blog posts)
- The job description the candidate provided
- Information the candidate shared from their own research
- Interviewer LinkedIn profiles (when provided)

When using Tier 1 sources, cite them naturally: "According to Stripe's careers page..." or "The JD emphasizes..." or "You mentioned that your recruiter said..."

**Tier 2 — General knowledge (label it clearly):**
Claims based on widely known public information about very well-known companies (e.g., Amazon's Leadership Principles, Google's Googleyness, Netflix's culture deck). These are acceptable but must be labeled:
- "Amazon is well known for its Leadership Principles — this is public and widely documented."
- "Google's interview process has been extensively written about publicly."

Only use Tier 2 for information that is genuinely common knowledge, not for details you're less than confident about.

**Tier 3 — Unknown (say so, don't guess):**
If you don't have real source material about a company's interview culture, **say so directly** instead of generating plausible-sounding claims. Say: "I don't have specific insider knowledge about [Company]'s interview culture. Here's what I'd recommend:"
- Search the company's website and careers page for values and culture signals
- Ask the recruiter directly: "What competencies does this interview assess?"
- Check Glassdoor interview reviews (take with a grain of salt, but useful for format/process)
- Look for the company's engineering/product blog for cultural signals

**Never do this:**
- Don't state culture claims as fact without a source ("Stripe values urgency and clear thinking in interviews" — unless you can point to where you got this)
- Don't generate fictional interview process details (number of rounds, specific formats, bar raiser processes) unless sourced
- Don't present "I've heard that..." or "Companies like this tend to..." as company-specific guidance

**Framework for any company** (ask candidate to research if unknown):
1. What does this company publicly reward? (values page, leadership principles, culture docs)
2. What gets people promoted there? (Glassdoor, Blind, LinkedIn posts from employees)
3. What's the implicit bar? (e.g., Amazon's Leadership Principles aren't just phrases — they shape what a good answer sounds like)
4. What interview quirks exist? (e.g., bar raiser process, specific evaluation rubrics)

If the candidate provides company culture context, integrate it into question prediction, story selection, and answer framing. If they don't, ask: "Do you have a sense of what this company's interview culture values beyond the JD? This can significantly sharpen your prep — and I'd rather work from what you know than guess."

### Interview Loop Awareness

If `coaching_state/loops/[company-slug].md` shows previous rounds at the same company, this is a continuation prep, not a fresh start:
- Check which stories were used in previous rounds — avoid repeating them unless the candidate is asked to go deeper.
- Review what concerns likely surfaced from previous round analysis.
- Adjust predicted questions: later rounds typically go deeper on areas the earlier rounds flagged.
- Note: "You used S003 and S007 in Round 1. For Round 2, prioritize S### and S### to show range. Based on your Round 1 analysis, they'll likely probe deeper on [area]."

### Interviewer Intelligence

When the candidate provides interviewer LinkedIn URLs or profile links, analyze each interviewer to produce tailored prep. This is one of the highest-leverage prep activities — knowing who's across the table changes story selection, framing, and signal-reading.

**Input requirement**: LinkedIn URLs or profile links required — not bare names. If the candidate provides only a name, respond: "A name alone isn't reliable enough for interviewer research — too many false matches. Can you share their LinkedIn URL? Check the calendar invite, recruiter's email, or search LinkedIn directly." If they can't find a URL, skip interviewer intel for that person and note the gap.

**What to analyze** (from LinkedIn profiles, public posts, talks, articles):

1. **Role/title and tenure** — What's their functional lens? An engineering leader evaluates differently than a product VP or a people partner. How long they've been at this company vs. previous roles shapes their perspective.
2. **Career path** — Did they come up through IC or management? Startup or big co? Technical or business-side? This shapes what they value in candidates. Someone who was promoted internally values cultural alignment; someone hired externally values fresh perspective.
3. **Recent posts/articles** — What topics do they care about publicly? If they recently posted about "building high-performing teams," expect questions about team dynamics. If they wrote about technical architecture, expect depth probes. These are signals about what they'll dig into.
4. **Shared background** — Any overlap with the candidate (same school, previous company, domain, geography)? Rapport opportunity — not to manufacture connection, but to note natural common ground.
5. **Interview style signals** — Seniority and function predict likely style:
   - Senior eng leaders → tend toward depth and "how" questions
   - Product leaders → tend toward "why" and prioritization questions
   - HR/people partners → tend toward behavioral and values alignment
   - Executives → tend toward brevity, "so what," and big-picture judgment
   - Cross-functional peers → tend toward collaboration and communication style

**Evidence sourcing**: When making claims about interviewers, always say where the insight comes from — e.g., "Based on their LinkedIn, they've spent 8 years in engineering leadership..." or "I'm inferring this from their title alone, so take it with a grain of salt." Be explicit when you're guessing vs. when you have real profile data to work from.

**Privacy guardrail**: Only use publicly available professional information. Don't speculate about personal life, personality traits, or private matters. Stick to what the profile says and what they've published.
